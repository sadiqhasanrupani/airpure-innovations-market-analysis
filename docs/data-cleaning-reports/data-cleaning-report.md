# Data Cleaning Report

## Overview
The AirPure Innovations project implemented a comprehensive data cleaning pipeline to enhance the quality of datasets including AQI, IDSP, Population Projections, and Vehicle Registrations. This report showcases the methodologies and results achieved.

---

## 1. Air Quality Index (AQI) Dataset
- **Standardization**:
  - Unified date formats and pollutant measures.
  - Corrected unit mismatches and capped extreme values.

- **Results**:
  - Ensured cohesive date and pollutant analysis.

## 2. IDSP Dataset
- **Logical Consistency**:
  - Verified case-death relationships and eliminated date inconsistencies.
  - Transformed and minimized outliers for a more symmetric data spread.

- **Duplicate Management**:
  - Critical columns scanned and duplicates removed for consistency.

## 3. Population Projections
- **Column Standardization**:
  - Ensured column names were consistent and easy to manage.

- **Duplicate and Missing Value Handling**:
  - Removed duplicate entries.
  - Managed NaNs with median/mode imputation for reliable analysis.

- **Final Checks**:
  - Logical checks confirmed zero inconsistencies, negative, or missing values.

## 4. Vahan Dataset
- **Process**:
  - Standardized column names and removed duplicate records.
  - Converted date columns and filled missing values appropriately.

- **Outliers**:
  - Anomaly detection processes applied to key attributes.

## Conclusion
The cleaning process significantly improved dataset integrity, resulting in datasets that are consistent, reliable, and ready for analysis. Statistical and logical checks were passed for all datasets, making them robust for further downstream applications.

## Recommendations
- Implement regular data validation routines.
- Utilize automated data monitoring to maintain quality.
