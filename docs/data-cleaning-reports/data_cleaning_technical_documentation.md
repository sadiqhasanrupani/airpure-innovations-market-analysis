# Data Cleaning Technical Documentation

## Overview
This document details the data cleaning process implemented in the AirPure Innovations project, focusing on enhancing data quality and consistency.

## Importing Libraries
- Utilized pandas and numpy for data manipulation and numerical operations.
- Employed seaborn, matplotlib, and plotly for visualization purposes.
- Integrated chardet for encoding detection to ensure correct data reading.

## Data Reading
- Implemented a `detect_encoding` function to identify the correct encoding utilizing the `chardet` library.
- Developed a `safe_read_csv` function to handle various encodings and prevent UnicodeDecodeError by falling back to utf-8 or latin1 if necessary.

## Quality Checks
- Used `display_df_info` function to review dataframes' structure and data types.
- Verified duplicates with a `duplicated` function on subsets of data for key fields to discover redundancy.
- Implemented comprehensive data quality reports using custom functions for outlier detection and statistical analysis.
- Validated logical consistency across all datasets with specific checks for each data type.

## Date Standardization
- Converted string date columns in AQI and IDSP datasets to pandas datetime using `pd.to_datetime` with error handling.
- Implemented date slicing to derive year, month, and day components for targeted time-based analysis.
- Standardized date formats across all datasets for consistent temporal analysis.

## Logical Consistency Validation
- Developed automated logical consistency checks for all datasets:
  - **IDSP Dataset**: Ensured `reporting_date` is not before `outbreak_starting_date` with automatic correction.
  - **IDSP Dataset**: Verified `deaths` column is non-negative and less than or equal to `cases`.
  - **Population Dataset**: Validated Total = Male + Female with zero tolerance for discrepancies.
  - **Vehicle Dataset**: Ensured consistent units and valid fuel type categorization.
- Implemented threshold-based validation with 20% inconsistency tolerance for automated fixes.

## Error Handling
- Incorporated exception handling during all critical data operations to prevent pipeline halts.
- Managed missing values by integrating imputation techniques, utilizing median/mode for numeric and categorical columns.

## Visualization
- Enabled comprehensive data visualization with descriptive statistics and visualization functions for greater analytical insight.

## Performance Optimization
- Leveraged vectorized solutions in pandas for efficient processing and reduced compute overhead.

## Audit and Compliance
- Maintained an audit trail with detailed logs of corrections, anomalies, and data issues for future review and compliance checks.
- Documented inconsistency resolutions and validated corrections against expected outcomes.

## Recommendations
### For Developers
- Utilize provided modular functions for consistency in future data handling processes.

### For Business Analysts
- Engage with visualizations for report generation and insights derivation.
- Continuously monitor data quality with implemented tools and raise flags for unexpected trends.
