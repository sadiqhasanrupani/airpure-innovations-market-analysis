### 📐 Metrics vs Dimensions

| Metrics (Quantitative)         | Dimensions (Qualitative/Categorical)         |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `aqi_value`                    | `state`                                     |
| `number_of_monitoring_stations` | `area`                                     |
| *(can count)* `air_quality_status` | `date`                                |
| *(can group by)* `prominent_pollutants` | `prominent_pollutants`           |

### 💡 Example Questions This Data Can Help Answer

- What is the **average AQI** across different states or months?
- Which **pollutant is most prominent** in metro cities?
- How many days had “Poor” air quality in Bengaluru between March and May?
- Does AQI improve on weekends vs weekdays?

---

### 🛑 Limitations

- Missing values in `note` or `unit`
- No latitude/longitude or GPS coordinates
- No exact time of day (only date)
