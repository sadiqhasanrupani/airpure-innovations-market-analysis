### 🔍 Primary Analysis (Transformed to Data Science Tasks):

1. **Top & Bottom AQI Areas (Dec 2024 – May 2025)**
   🔁 *Original:* Identify top 5 and bottom 5 areas with highest average AQI.
   🧠 *Data Science Version:*

   * **Train a clustering model** (e.g., KMeans, DBSCAN) on spatiotemporal AQI trends to identify natural groupings of high-risk vs. low-risk zones.
   * **Model AQI distributions** over time and space using **geospatial time series models** (e.g., ST-GCNs or Prophet with spatial overlays).

2. **Prominent Pollutants per State**
   🔁 *Original:* Top/bottom 2 pollutants for each southern Indian state post-2022.
   🧠 *Data Science Version:*

   * Perform **PCA or factor analysis** to reduce pollutant dimensions and detect **state-level pollutant signatures**.
   * Train **multi-class classifiers** to predict pollutant dominance based on location, weather, and seasonality.

3. **Weekend vs. Weekday AQI in Metro Cities**
   🔁 *Original:* Compare AQI between weekdays and weekends in 8 major cities.
   🧠 *Data Science Version:*

   * Use **statistical hypothesis testing** (e.g., paired t-test, Wilcoxon test) to assess significant AQI shifts.
   * Extend to a **time-series causal impact model** to analyze intervention effects (e.g., lockdowns or car-free days).

4. **Worst Air Quality Months**
   🔁 *Original:* Identify consistently bad AQI months in top 10 states.
   🧠 *Data Science Version:*

   * Build a **seasonal decomposition model** to forecast AQI levels and detect **recurring annual pollution spikes** using SARIMA or Prophet.
   * **Classify months** using **unsupervised techniques** like t-SNE + clustering.

5. **AQI Category Distribution in Bengaluru (Mar–May 2025)**
   🔁 *Original:* Count AQI category days.
   🧠 *Data Science Version:*

   * **Train a multi-class classification model** (e.g., LightGBM) to predict AQI category using weather, traffic, and population mobility data.
   * Analyze **misclassification regions** to detect unusual pollution surges.

6. **Diseases vs. AQI per State (Last 3 Years)**
   🔁 *Original:* Top 2 diseases with average AQI.
   🧠 *Data Science Version:*

   * Build **correlation or regression models** (e.g., Poisson Regression) linking AQI to **health outcomes** using hospitalization or IDSP data.
   * Explore **Granger causality tests** to determine if AQI predicts disease outbreaks.

7. **EV Adoption vs. AQI Improvement**
   🔁 *Original:* Compare AQI in states with high EV adoption.
   🧠 *Data Science Version:*

   * Use **causal inference techniques** (e.g., DiD – Difference-in-Differences or Propensity Score Matching) to estimate the effect of EV adoption on AQI.
   * Integrate **EV registration data + AQI trends** into a **panel data regression**.

### 🔍 Secondary Analysis (Data Science Version)

1. **Age Group Most Affected by Pollution**
   🧠 Predict hospitalization likelihood using AQI exposure + age as input to **logistic regression or survival models**.

2. **Indian Air Purifier Market Competitor Mapping**
   🧠 Use **NLP-based product clustering** (based on scraped product descriptions/specs) to identify feature gaps.

   * Apply **topic modeling (LDA)** to customer reviews.

3. **Population Size vs. AQI Relationship**
   🧠 Use **nonlinear regression** or **Random Forest Regression** to model the relationship and test hypothesis: "Do larger cities have higher AQI?"

4. **AQI Awareness Among Citizens**
   🧠 Analyze **Google Trends** and **Twitter sentiment** using **NLP + time series modeling** to estimate public awareness over time.

5. **Policy Impact Analysis**
   🧠 Use **causal impact models** (e.g., Bayesian Structural Time Series) to quantify the effect of major government interventions on AQI.
