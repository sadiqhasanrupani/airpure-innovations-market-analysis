### üî¨ **Data Scientist Resume Project**

#### ‚úÖ **Step-by-Step Guide (Data Scientist Version)**

---

### üìÖ **Enrollment and Setup**

* Enroll via the **Ongoing Resume Project Challenge** section.
* Click **"Enroll for Free"** to join the challenge.
* Download the ZIP file containing:

  * **Dataset** (CSV format)
  * **Supporting Documents** (problem description, data dictionary, previous analyses, etc.)

---

### üìå **Problem Statement**

You are expected to go beyond basic reporting. Your role is to:

* **Build predictive models** or **classification/regression algorithms** to solve a clearly defined problem.
* Generate **actionable insights** using **statistical inference** or **machine learning**.
* Communicate your findings with **model interpretability techniques** and **data storytelling**.

Example Problems:

* Forecast demand, customer churn, or sales.
* Predict AQI levels using multivariate time series.
* Detect anomalies in transaction data using unsupervised learning.
* Build a recommender system for retail datasets.

---

### üß† **Explore and Hypothesize**

* Perform **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** to uncover trends, patterns, and relationships.
* Form hypotheses around key variables.
* Use statistical tests (ANOVA, chi-square, correlation analysis) to validate your assumptions.

---

### ü§ñ **Model Development**

* Based on the objective, develop machine learning models such as:

  * Regression (Linear, Ridge, Lasso)
  * Classification (Logistic, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM)
  * Time-Series Forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM)
  * Clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN)
* Apply **cross-validation** and **hyperparameter tuning**.
* Evaluate performance with **precision, recall, RMSE, AUC**, or appropriate metrics.

---

### üìä **Model Interpretation & Insights**

* Use **SHAP, LIME, Feature Importance** to interpret models.
* Translate model outputs into business-friendly insights.
* Include **what-if analysis** or scenario testing.

---

### üìΩÔ∏è **Presentation and Submission**

* Create a LinkedIn post explaining:

  * Business problem
  * Analytical approach
  * Modeling techniques
  * Key insights and recommendations
  * Link to your GitHub/portfolio
* Tag **@codebasics**, **@Dhaval Patel**, and **@Hemanand Vadivel**.
* Submit the solution:

  * **Video Presentation** (< 15 minutes) explaining the solution and model.
  * OR PDF/Image-based summary (only if video is not feasible).

---

### üèÜ **Winners Announcement**

* Winners will be featured on **YouTube** and **Instagram @codebasicshub**.
* Top models will be highlighted with GitHub links for community learning.

---

### üìö **Build Your Portfolio**

* Work on previous **data scientist challenges** to sharpen your skills.
* Showcase your work on GitHub and LinkedIn with technical blogs or notebooks.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Tools You Can Use**

* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, StatsModels, TensorFlow/PyTorch for deep learning)
* Jupyter Notebooks / Google Colab
* Git & GitHub
* Power BI or Tableau (optional for dashboarding)
