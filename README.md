# 🌀 AirPure Innovations – Pan-India AQI Intelligence

A personal project that simulates the role of a data analyst for a fictional air purifier startup. This project analyzes AQI, health, EV, and demographic data across Indian cities to generate actionable insights for market research, product design, and go-to-market strategy.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

> How can a new air purifier startup identify the right markets, features, and launch strategy across India using AQI, health, and behavior data?

This project answers:

* Which **pollutants** should be prioritized?
* Which **cities** are facing irreversible AQI degradation?
* How do AQI levels correlate with **health burdens**?
* Are **EV adoption** and **awareness** helping improve air quality?
* Where is the **demand for air purifiers** rising most rapidly?

## 📊 Key Features

* 🔬 **Pollutant Profiling**: PM2.5 and PM10 dominance across Tier-1/2 cities.
* 🧭 **City Risk Score**: Combines AQI × population × income to rank cities.
* 🏥 **Health Correlation**: Asthma & respiratory data aligned with AQI spikes.
* ⚡ **EV Impact**: Evaluates if EV-friendly cities show improved AQI.
* 🗺️ **Interactive Power BI Dashboard**: Filters by time, region, pollutant.
* 🧠 **Business Intelligence Layer**: Designed for product managers & strategists.

---

## 🧾 Deliverables

* ✅ Power BI interactive dashboard
* ✅ Jupyter notebooks for preprocessing + EDA
* ✅ PPT presentation for stakeholders *(coming soon...)*
* ✅ Strategic market recommendations
* ✅ Custom DAX formulas & calculated KPIs
* ✅ Repository with organized folder structure

---

## 🧩 Sample Insights

* **Winter months** show peak pollution across Northern states.
* **Byrnihat *(from Assam)***, **Delhi**, **Hajipur** rank high in AQI.
* **Madikeri *(from karnatak)*** shows low AQI but surprising respiratory impact → niche opportunity.
* High **EV adoption** is loosely correlated with slight AQI improvement.

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

* 🔍 Integrate **Google Trends** to measure search demand for air purifiers.
* 📡 Use **satellite crop-burning** data for AQI spike analysis.
* 🧪 Add predictive AQI modeling using time series forecasting (Prophet/ARIMA).
* 🌐 Host dashboard using **Streamlit** or **Power BI Embedded**.
